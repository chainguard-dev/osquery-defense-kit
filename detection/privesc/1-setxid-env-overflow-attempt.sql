-- Find setuid process events with large environment sizes

-- ******************************************************************
-- NOTE: This is a rare case of a non-working query. It does not work
-- in my environment (osquery 5.5.1 running with Kolide) as
-- process_events.env_size is NULL. I believe this to be a bug, but
-- requires more investigation.
